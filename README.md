## 🔢 Subnetting Guide

### Understanding /26 Subnetting

Your assigned /24 network (256 addresses) will be divided into **four equal /26 subnets** (64 addresses each):

| Subnet | Purpose | Range | CIDR |
|--------|---------|-------|------|
| Subnet 1 | Domain Controller | x.x.x.0 - x.x.x.63 | /26 |
| Subnet 2 | Azure Bastion | x.x.x.64 - x.x.x.127 | /26 |
| Subnet 3 | Web Server | x.x.x.128 - x.x.x.191 | /26 |
| Subnet 4 | Client | x.x.x.192 - x.x.x.255 | /26 |

### Example Calculation

**Given:** 131.131.131.0/24

**Result:**
```
vnet1-subnet1:       131.131.131.0/26
AzureBastionSubnet:  131.131.131.64/26
vnet2-subnet1:       131.131.131.128/26
vnet3-subnet1:       131.131.131.192/26
```

**Subnet Mask:** 255.255.255.192

**Usable Hosts per Subnet:** 62

For detailed subnetting instructions, see the complete guide.

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### 1. Cannot Connect via Bastion
- ✔️ Verify VM is running
- ✔️ Check Bastion deployment status
- ✔️ Confirm VM is in peered network
- ✔️ Wait 2-3 minutes after VM restart

#### 2. Domain Join Fails
- ✔️ Verify DNS settings point to DC
- ✔️ Check network peering status
- ✔️ Restart VM after DNS changes
- ✔️ Test DNS resolution: `nslookup domain.com`

#### 3. Domain User Cannot Login
- ✔️ Add user to Remote Desktop Users group
- ✔️ Configure Group Policy for logon rights
- ✔️ Run `gpupdate /force` on all VMs
- ✔️ Use correct username format: `user@domain.com`

#### 4. Website Not Accessible
- ✔️ Verify DNS A record exists
- ✔️ Check IIS is running
- ✔️ Test from webserver locally first
- ✔️ Flush DNS cache: `ipconfig /flushdns`

For complete troubleshooting guide, see the main documentation.
